## Universal System Capabilities

### Policy-Agnostic Design
âœ… Zero Code Changes required for new policies
âœ… Dynamic Policy Discovery from evidence content
âœ… Universal Evidence Parsing for any compliance domain
âœ… Generic Rule Loading from Spanner Graph
âœ… Cross-Policy Validation with relationship detection
âœ… Multi-Policy Support in single workflow

### Supported Policy Types (Extensible)
- Policy 101: Test Execution (scripts, data, plans, outcomes, defects)
- Policy 201: Security Compliance (scans, assessments, reviews)
- Policy 301: Deployment Validation (procedures, rollback, monitoring)
- Policy 401: Code Review (reviews, static analysis, quality)
- Policy 501: Documentation (technical docs, APIs, guides)
- Unlimited: Any future policy automatically supported

### Universal API Endpoints
- POST /validate/generic-compliance - Universal validation for any policy
- POST /validate/policies/discover - Auto-detect applicable policies
- GET /policies/catalog - Available policies and categories
- GET /health - System health monitoring
- GET /ready - Component readiness verification

### Advanced Features
ðŸ”§ Hybrid RAG Pipeline - Graph + Vector retrieval for any domain
ðŸ”§ Multi-Domain Embeddings - Cross-policy evidence similarity
ðŸ”§ Policy Hierarchies - Rule dependencies and cross-references
ðŸ”§ Evidence Type Mapping - Dynamic classification per policy
ðŸ”§ Assessment Templates - Policy-specific LLM prompts
ðŸ”§ Audit Trails - Complete validation history
